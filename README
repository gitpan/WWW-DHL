NAME
    DHL - Perl module for the DHL online tracking service.

SYNOPSIS
      my $dhl = DHL->new(ID => 12345);
      print Dumper $dhl->status();
      ...

DESCRIPTION
    This module allows you to check the status of YOUR shipments via the DHL
    website. For privacy issues please consider the website. Please note:
    This module is still some kind of alpha, because there are many
    different pages on the DHL website.

METHODS
    DHL->new()
        Obligatory method to create the DHL object. You can pass the
        following fields: ID, Zip, Reference and Abroad.

    $dhl->status()
        This method will try to fetch the status from the website. If there
        is an error, it will return undef and set $@. Otherwise you will get
        a hashref containing everything we could find at the status page.

BUGS
    Please contact the author, if you find bugs in this code.
